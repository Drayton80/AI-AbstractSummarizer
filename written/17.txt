<original id=A7W.22.5>`` But I find it totally incomprehensible if someone has held the office of Chancellor with high standing for six years to want to resign over a personality --- with such suddenness and haste. '' The clash came as Mr Kinnock exploited the apparent contradiction between Mrs Thatcher 's claim that she did not know why Mr Lawson resigned and the former Chancellor 's assertion in last Sunday 's Walden interview that he had made it quite clear to the Prime Minister that Sir Alan Walter 's continued presence as her economic adviser was the only issue .</original>

<original id=A7W.22.9>It was quite clear he was determined to go and go that day. '' Mrs Thatcher later parried more questions when the Liberal Democrat Mr Charles Kennedy ( Ross , Cromarty and Skye ) asked her whether she felt her `` diminishing credibility '' would be salvaged if she followed the advice of the former chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee , Sir Edward du Cann , that a leadership challenge would clear the air .</original>
