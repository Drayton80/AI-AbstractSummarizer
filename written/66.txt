<original id=AL6.42.1>The wall of molten lava has come to a virtual halt 150 yards from the first home in the town , but officials said yesterday that its flow appeared to have picked up speed further up the slope .</original>

<original id=AL6.42.4>Some experts say that even if the eruption stopped today , the sheer pressure of lava piled up behind for six miles would bring debris cascading down on to the town anyway .</original>
