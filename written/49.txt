<original id=AAL.37.1>The former Cabinet minister refused to rule out the possibility in the wake of his scornful accusation that the Prime Minister 's shrewd political instincts had been led astray by the `` Irish logic '' of the Foreign Office , though he did say it was `` very unlikely '' .</original>

<original id=AAL.37.3>Coming on top of Wednesday 's Commons confrontation with Mr Doulgas Hurd , the Foreign Secretary --- in front of Mrs Thatcher --- Mr Tebbit 's column in yesterday 's London Evening Standard dramatically departed from normally discreet Tory methods of party in-fighting .</original>

<original id=AAL.37.5>He even named the Government Chief Whip , Mr Tim Renton , and the party chairman , Mr Kenneth Baker , as Waddington allies who `` saw the danger ( but ) failed to prevent such a folly '' which , Mr Tebbit argued , was in danger of handing back to an opportunist Labour Party the very `` key group of voters whose support is vital for a fourth election victory '' --- by implication Tory populists sensitive to what he called `` being swamped by people of different culture , history and religion '' .</original>

<original id=AAL.37.6>In another passage evocative of past attempts to play the race card , Mr Tebbit wrote that `` most people in Britain did not want to live in a multicultural , multiracial society , but it has been foisted on them '' .</original>

<original id=AAL.37.8>But even some admirers were puzzled by the aggressively public way he has pursued it , the more so since he has been careful to acknowledge that there may not be enough rebels to defeat the Government 's legislation with --- `` a sad day for me '' --- Labour 's help .</original>
