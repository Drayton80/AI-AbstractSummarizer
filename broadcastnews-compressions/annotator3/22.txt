<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.0>This week , as the Russian election approaches , we are going to hear from several observers of Russian politics about the choice Russians face - whether to extend Boris Yeltsin 's presidency or opt for Gennady Zyuganov 's brand of communism .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.1>While that choice strikes many as momentous , British journalist Jonathan Steele [ sp ] says that Yeltsin and Zyuganov appear to campaigning on the same promises .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.2>Well , I think President Yeltsin has really stolen a lot of Zyuganov 's clothes over the last weeks and months .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.3>He now talks about reviving Russia as a great power , so it 's a much more assertive kind of nationalist language than we used to hear from Yeltsin in the past when he was very pro-Western .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.4>Secondly , he 's talking about spending much more to help the poorest sections of society .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.6>He 's talking about some sort of controls on imports to protect Russian industry , so I think in many ways this sort of nationalist , protectionist , more state interventionist type of policy which the Communists advocate is really very similar to what Yeltsin now says he would do .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.7>But do you think that this suggests a real lack of conviction on Boris Yeltsin 's part for the kind of policies that he has advanced as president , or is it simply a tactical abandonment of those for the campaign , and then policies that he would likely return to if he were re-elected ?</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.8>Well , I think it reflects a general current of change in Russian opinion over the last couple of years or so .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.9>I think there has been a disillusionment with the way the market economy was brought in and a feeling that you now have to correct it to some extent .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.10>So , I think what Yeltsin is doing is partly tactical in the sense that he sees it 's the best way to get votes and get more in tune with the center of Russian opinion , but I think it , therefore , is something that he probably would stick to , more or less , even if he won a second term .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.11>You 're suggesting that actually the political outlook of Russia 's Communist Party is much more in tune with Russia of 1996 than the Yeltsin government over the past couple of years .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.12>Well , on two points certainly .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.13>One is on the economy , as I say , and the other is on this sense that somehow Russia has been humiliated over the last five or seven years .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.14>The kind of loss of empire mood , which Russians seem to have got over very quickly at the time they were , in fact , losing the empire in 1990 and '91 , can be seen as a sort of deep-seated wound that has n't really healed , and the Communists are talking about patriotism .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.15>They 're talking about Russia having been humiliated and a need to stand on its own feet again , even if that means not being so pro-Western .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.17>I think the real difference is one of speculation about the future- is which one of these two men , if elected , would be least likely to tamper with civil liberties in the future and therefore roll back the democratic reforms of the Gorbachev years .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.18>Is , in that sense , Boris Yeltsin a democrat ?</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.20>Well that , I think , is the big debate .</original>
<compressed id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.20>that is the big debate .</compressed>
<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.21>Take the television , for example .</original>
<compressed id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.21>Take the television .</compressed>
<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.22>All three television channels - the only three that have national coverage - are now controlled by the president .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.23>So you could argue , perhaps slightly flippantly , that if you want an opposition media , the best thing is to vote Zyuganov , because then all the three national TV stations would be against the new president .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.24>But I mean that 's just an illustration of the fact that Yeltsin has really taken into his hands - in a way that we would n't think acceptable in a Western country - the main broadcast media .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.25>On the question of rights to free assembly , political parties and so on , I think this has to be speculative .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.26>All one can say is that Zyuganov , after all , after 2-1/2 years as a parliamentarian - somebody who knows that you ca n't go back to one-party rule , that you have to do deals , make coalitions , try and keep up some sort of dialogue with parties that do n't automatically support you - has shown some experience and some loyalty , such as it is , to parliamentarism .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.27>With Yeltsin , this is a bit questionable .</original>

<original id=bn9623.rpi_segs.txt.960610.124.31>So , in those ways , I think the jury has to be a little bit out on how much of a real democrat Yeltsin is - or Zyuganov - because we know less about Zyuganov .</original>
