<original id=bn9624.rpi_segs.txt.960619.624.3>Well , very little additional information to add at this point , Miles , although Pentagon sources tell us this was not a U.S. military plane - that apparently , it was an older F-18 that had once been used by the Navy , but was now being leased back to McDonnell Douglas , who was using it for its own purposes .</original>

<original id=bn9624.rpi_segs.txt.960619.624.4>Pentagon sources here tell us that the pilot of the plane , whose fate we still do n't know , was apparently a McDonnell Douglas test pilot , not a U.S. military pilot .</original>

<original id=bn9624.rpi_segs.txt.960619.624.5>Other than that , sources here confirm that they 've heard the reports that the F-18 crashed in a residential area northeast of St. Louis , Missouri , in the town of Bethalto , Illinois , and that- of course , St. Louis is the headquarters of McDonnell Douglas , where the F-18 is manufactured .</original>

<original id=bn9624.rpi_segs.txt.960619.624.8>And we 're still waiting for details on whether the pilot escaped injury - was able to eject , and whether or not anyone was hurt on the ground .</original>
